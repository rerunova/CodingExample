# Coding Example

This is some code a wrote a few years ago for an Interview under a time limit. It is short and brief but shows I can code and can be discussed. Please read Documentation\Start Here - Instructions - Release Retention.md for a description of the task. 

I don't have any projects available on my GitHub that I would personally like to share or give access to. None of my professionally completed work can be shared for the usual expected reasons.

There was a temptation to do the unethical thing and either branch something on GitHub or use an LLM (eg: Chat GPT) to write something quickly, but decided against that for many many reasons.

Hopefully you enjoy!
